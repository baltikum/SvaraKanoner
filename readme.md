Technical mumbo jumbo
-----

The program exists of two applications, one client and one server. </br>
The server needs to be running before the application and is watching on port 12345 so you need to port 
forward it and allow it through your firewall if not running on a local network. Inorder to change the ip address
the ipAddress line in settings.ini needs to be changed. If you don't see the settings.ini file first start the client and
then stop it again then it should appear.
